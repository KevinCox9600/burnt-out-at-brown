Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms.

We will investigate funerary rituals and burial, and the movement of living bodies in dance and in civic and religious processions.

One of the most famous philosophers of the 17th century, he was French but wrote his works while living in exile in the Dutch Republic. While his ideas are much debated, little is known about his personal life, especially before he settled in the Republic in 1628, despite many hints about his years as a soldier, his extensive travels in Europe, and his possible political and occult associations. This seminar is designed as a collective exploration into the small pieces of evidence about his early life and the lives of his friends and enemies in order to put mind and body back together rather than to treat them separately.

While the primary focus is the contemporary US policy state, the course also examines American policymaking in cross-national perspective. Policymaking is a complex process in which outcomes are shaped by the interplay of interests, ideas, and institutions. To understand these outcomes, the course draws on theories of policymaking, public administration, public law, and institutionalism as frameworks of analysis. Substantive topics include the US welfare state, legislative politics, federalism, the influence of racial politics in policymaking, policy feedback, the consequences of partisan polarization for governance, and government as a problem-solving institution.", "cr_data_available": "false"}, "POLS2075": {"dept": "POLS", "num": "2075", "code": "POLS2075", "name": "Social Groups in U.S. Politics", "prof": "K.
