During this seminar, we will discuss how archaeologists can engage with the public\u2014including collaborations with indigenous and local communities, increased multivocality in interpretations, the mass media, museums, educational outreach programs, and the use and abuse of the past by governments and others in power. Much of the learning for this course will come as part of hands-on projects undertaken in collaboration with community partner organizations. These engaged scholarship projects are designed to link students with community members and practitioners as co-learners and co-creators to create positive change in our community, and to help students form deep ties to Providence and Rhode Island beyond the walls of Brown University, and to offer students a hands-on perspective on how archaeology can effect change in our communities.", "writ": false, "fys": false, "soph": false}, {"num": "1214", "dept": "ARCH", "name": "The Viking Age (HIST 1210A)", "time": "", "prof": "See details", "description": "Interested students must register for <a href=\"/search/?p=HIST%201210A\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIST 1210A\" >HIST 1210A</a>.", "writ": false, "fys": false, "soph": false}, {"num": "1233", "dept": "ARCH", "name": "Ancient Maya Writing (ANTH 1650)", "time": "", "prof": "See details", "description": "Interested students must register for <a href=\"/search/?p=ANTH%201650\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:ANTH 1650\" >ANTH 1650</a>.", "writ": false, "fys": false, "soph": false}, {"num": "1234", "dept": "ARCH", "name": "Lost Languages: The Decipherment and Study of Ancient Writing Systems (ANTH 1820)", "time": "", "prof": "See details", "description": "Interested students must register for <a href=\"/search/?p=ANTH%201820\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:ANTH 1820\" >ANTH 1820</a>.", "writ": false, "fys": false, "soph": false}, {"num": "1434", "dept": "ARCH", "name": "\nJerusalem: Jews, Christians, Muslims (UNIV 1003).", "time": "", "prof": "See details", "description": "Interested students must register for <a href=\"/search/?p=UNIV%201003\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:UNIV 1003\" >UNIV 1003</a>.", "writ": false, "fys": false, "soph": false}, {"num": "1487", "dept": "ARCH", "name": "Environmental History of East Asia (HIST 1820B)", "time": "", "prof": "See details", "description": "Interested students must register for <a href=\"/search/?p=HIST%201820B\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIST 1820B\" >HIST 1820B</a>.", "writ": false, "fys": false, "soph": false}, {"num": "1501", "dept": "ARCH", "name": "Islamic Art in the RISD Museum: Thinking With Objects (HIAA 1418).", "time": "", "prof": "See details", "description": "Interested students must register for <a href=\"/search/?p=HIAA%201418\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:HIAA 1418\" >HIAA 1418</a>.", "writ": false, "fys": false, "soph": false}, {"num": "1536", "dept": "ARCH", "name": "Archeological Ethnographies: Heritage and Community in the Mediterranean (ANTH 1126)", "time": "", "prof": "See details", "description": "Interested students must register for <a href=\"/search/?p=ANTH%201126\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:ANTH 1126\" >ANTH 1126</a>.", "writ": false, "fys": false, "soph": false}, {"num": "1539", "dept": "ARCH", "name": "Gastronomic Heritage (ANTH 1920).", "time": "", "prof": "See details", "description": "Interested students must register for <a href=\"/search/?p=ANTH%201920\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:ANTH 1920\" >ANTH 1920</a>.", "writ": false, "fys": false, "soph": false}, {"num": "1602", "dept": "ARCH", "name": "The Age of Empires: The Ancient Near East in the First Millennium BC (ASYR 1300)", "time": "", "prof": "See details", "description": "Interested students must register for <a href=\"/search/?p=ASYR%201300\" data-action=\"result-detail\" data-group=\"code:ASYR 1300\" >ASYR 1300</a>.", "writ": false, "fys": false, "soph": false}, {"num": "1630", "dept": "ARCH", "name": "Fighting Pharaohs: Ancient Egyptian Warfare", "time": "TTh 2:30-3:50p", "prof": "L.

As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs.
