Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered.

We seek to understand how dilemmas over and struggles for belonging and equality in the United States have played out in and over urban and suburban spaces. We will pay particular attention to the histories of segregation, housing discrimination, urban unrest, suburban integration, the rise of \u201cethnoburbs,\u201d and gentrification. Readings represent foundational texts and new directions in scholarship and provide in-depth examinations of particular urban and suburban communities. Topics include the simultaneous erasure and appropriation of Indigenous peoples in the development of Pacific Northwest cities; the Asian American \u201cmodel minority\u201d and integration of all-white suburbs; minority grassroots activism and resistance against redevelopment; racism and neoliberal urban governance in the 21st century.
