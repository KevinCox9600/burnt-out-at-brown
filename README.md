# burnt-out-at-brown
A website that displays a list of courses at Brown known to have the lowest workloads to enable students to optimize their work/life balance

The scrape-cab.py file logs into CAB to scrape a list of courses offered this semester (spring '22) at Brown and their corresponding data (course number, department, name, time, and professor), and formats the data as a json. scrape-cr.py then reads through the json that scrape-cab.py outputted. For each course in the json, scrape-cr.py goes to thecriticalreview.com for that page and scrapes additional data (the critical review link, the course and professor ratings, the average and max time commitment, the number of respondents, class size, and additional unpublished info). scrape-py.cr creates two json files from this aggregated data: (1) class_objs.json, which is a dictionary from course code to a list of course reviews (and corresponding data) for that course, and (2) prof_objs.json, which is a dictionary from the professor to the list of course reviews (and corresponding data) for courses they have taught. These two jsons allow for front-end manipulation of the data, such as sorting courses or professors by least workload.
