This course asks how popular culture\u2014from cinema to television and digital media\u2014has dealt with these myriad changes, from attempts to represent changes in the global capitalist economy to their very impact on creative industries.

It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs.

In this course, we will be seeing how crime was perceived and punished in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome. From mythical accounts of murders to real records of trials of humans, animals, and even objects accused of homicide, we will analyze how aspects of social status or gender played a role in shaping punishment across ancient civilizations. We will look at three ancient cold cases, and perhaps you may be able to help solve an ancient mystery! At the end of the semester we will recreate ancient trials using the same crime, evidence, and participants, but following the law and procedures of each one of the civilizations covered in this course.
