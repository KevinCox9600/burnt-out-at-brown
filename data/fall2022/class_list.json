The sequence requires no previous programming experience. Indeed, few high school students are exposed to functional programming; hence even students with previous programming experience often find this sequence an invaluable part of their education.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough students are taught to use programming languages as tools, the goal of CSCI0170/0180 is not merely to teach programming. On the contrary, the goal is to convey to students that computer science is much more than programming! All of the following fundamental computer science techniques are integrated into the course material: algorithms, data structures, analysis, problem solving, abstract reasoning, and collaboration. Concrete examples are drawn from different subareas of computer science: in 0170, from arbitrary-precision arithmetic, natural language processing, databases, and strategic games; in 0180, from discrete-event simulation, data compression, and client/server architectures.<br/>", "writ": false, "fys": false, "soph": false}, {"num": "0190", "dept": "CSCI", "name": "Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science", "time": "MWF 9-9:50a", "prof": "S.

The sequence is unique in teaching both the functional and imperative programming paradigms---the first through the languages Scheme and ML in CSCI0170; the second through Java in CSCI0180. The sequence requires no previous programming experience. Indeed, few high school students are exposed to functional programming; hence even students with previous programming experience often find this sequence an invaluable part of their education.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough students are taught to use programming languages as tools, the goal of CSCI0170/0180 is not merely to teach programming. On the contrary, the goal is to convey to students that computer science is much more than programming! All of the following fundamental computer science techniques are integrated into the course material: algorithms, data structures, analysis, problem solving, abstract reasoning, and collaboration. Concrete examples are drawn from different subareas of computer science: in 0170, from arbitrary-precision arithmetic, natural language processing, databases, and strategic games; in 0180, from discrete-event simulation, data compression, and client/server architectures.<br/>", "writ": false, "fys": false, "soph": false}, {"num": "0190", "dept": "CSCI", "name": "Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science", "time": "MWF 9-9:50a", "prof": "S.

Analysis of dynamical and statistical network properties: stationarity, directed transfer functions, stability and bifurcations, phase transitions. Related applications to prediction, control, low-dimensional representation, probabilistic neural population encoding and decoding are introduced as well. This is a course for senior undergraduate and graduate students with a background in systems/computational neuroscience and/or applied math/biomedical engineering. Lectures are accompanied by hands-on Python/Matlab-based applications to real and simulated neural data. Topics include: (1) Time and spectral domain models of network dynamics based on multivariate neural time series and point process observations with exogenous inputs; vector autoregressive processes, nonlinear Hawkes processes; stability, transfer functions; (2) Identification of directed interactions in networks of neurons and brain inter-areal communication (Granger causality, transfer entropy, ODE networks); (3) Collective dynamics and low-dimensional representations of network dynamics; (4) Prediction, neural population encoding and decoding for brain-computer interfaces: Bayesian probabilistic approaches based on linear/nonlinear state-space models, machine learning; (5) Data assimilation methods for modeling neural network dynamics. Example datasets include neuronal spike trains, local field potentials, ECoG/SEEG.
