Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms.

Focusing on questions of gender and sexuality, we will address topics such as queergaming and cyberfeminism, disembodied AI-chatbots and the datafication of the body, algorithmic socio-affective extraction and surrogate-digital labor, Black data and the deep-web, biopower and pharmaco-power. Through technical workshops (video/coding/live-media), theoretical explorations (critical theories of gender, disability, sexuality, and race as they intersect with contemporary art making), students will engage with a series of short creative assignments and develop a major project. This final project can manifest as a digital-media installation, AI-based artwork, sound piece, art film, multimedia performance, and more.
