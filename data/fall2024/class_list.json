Even obviously flesh-and-blood persons (e.g. Regulus, Hannibal, Caesar, Cleopatra) take on mythical status.

Tuesday lectures will alternate with collaborative readings &amp; short writing assignments based on primary sources, including oral histories, court transcripts, and government documents on Thursdays, with the goal of building new ways of linking law, sovereignty, and ecological change. Readings will be supplemented with secondary works of history, anthropology, theory, ecology, and guest visits from regional experts and Elders.

The path that an artist takes to develop a work is one that is non-linear, messy, and full of wonderful byways.
